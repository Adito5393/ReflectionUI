

This library allows to generate automatically the GUI (general user interface) of any Java object.

The generation of the GUI requires no other information that the object itself. Its structure is discovered at runtime through Java reflection.

The genrated GUI can be customized in a non-intrusive way by overriding some key methods of the generator objects.


- update translatable strings
- check getSubObjectEd is used where it should
- be careful with UiManager.getColor
- private => protected
