/*
 * public boolean openValueDialog(...): This method must allow to edit a
 * value, report the new value and the detailed value modifications.
 * Value modifications are needed because there may not be any new
 * object but rather an old object with its internal fields modified.
 * Due to the opacity of methods invocation impacts, the modifications
 * may not be well reported. If so, in the doubt the value must be
 * considered as new. To allow that methods must report "UNKNOWN"
 * modifications.

/*
 * Issue: field value read only is not the same as field value
 * sub-fields read only. If the field is read only then it must be
 * reflected when the field value is wrapped. If the field is not
 * wrapped then there is no need to reflect any read only feature in the
 * form. It must be rather reflected in the bottom buttons: read only
 * implies no OK button. But if it is so, then there is no way to create 
 read only viewers when needed, for instance to display Exceptions. But
 why would it be necessary for exception dialog to be read only, more
 over if the developers explicitly allowed to modify them. But it would
 anyway be interesting to have the possibility to build read only viewers.

- openObjectDialog() cannot detect changes of objects with only methods.
Change should be detected each time a rw method is invoked???
even if we o not know how to revert it
- guessing rules are too complicated to understand by 
developers. Maybe they should be moved to editable metadatas.
- metatada wysiwyg editor???
- it is impossible for custom field controls to prevent 
modfications of non-primitive values because readonly field
does not imply ICollectionSettings.allreadOnly for the field 
value  
- colors should never be set on components,
otherwise lookandfeel dynamic change is not taken into account.
See:
	. TextControl
	. listControl.treeControl
- menus???
- listControl: 
	. deatil view
- update translatable strings
- private => protected
- new controls:
	. spinner, slider for numbers
	. dateChooser
	. colorChooser
