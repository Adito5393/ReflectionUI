- allow easy control/types extension:
	. how to allow to configure the controls
- cannot hide field as getter/setter
- allow to name methodASField|fiedlAsMethod
- allow to merge to getter/setter methods into 1 field
- allow to set (min) list size ???
- move member small bug: need to do it twice sometimes
- cutomization refresh looses list selction
- method execution on list item did not refresh the list
- allow to ignore method result
- allow to force close method execution window after 
the first call even if there are parameters 
- fiedl.displyAsEncapsulated should not encapsulate null
	=> allows to make active/details like field control  


- method controls in other category tabs are not well initialized
	and they take too much horizontal space
- reflectionUI is often excluded from hashCode() and equals()
	=> justified ?
- allow to specify ImplicitListField in customizations
- dialog/panel creation is sometimes slow but no busy dialog shown
	<= multiple small showBusyDialogWHile() calls are done
	=> find a way to show the busy dialog anyway
- check how duplicate field names are handled
- ListControl calls too much list.toArray()
	=> optimize
. allow to execute dynamic actions or change dynamic properties on 
multiple nodes
. restore all control states on refresh,
	even non-focused controls???
ex: embedded form tabbed pane selection
. expose more customizations feature
	. screenshot
. allow to customize List item double click defaut action ???
- allow to unlock cutomization toolls at runtime
- allow to customize icons for:
	. fields: can be postponed as field controls need to be updated
- icon on title bar???
- allow to customize online help on list properties/actions
- allow to override default tooltips help on method controls
- provide swingRenderer.openAutoRollbackableDialog()
- normally a field control must be customizable for only 1 field.
Currently, customizations affects all fields having the same type  
- allow to clean customizations
- ITypeInfo.getName() should not be used for finding controls???
- write hashCode() & equals() of some inner classes where the IDE
could not generate them
- Type params must be get from the IField/MethodInfo, not ITypeInfo
just like in the Java spec.
	. add IFieldInfo.getTypeParameters()
	https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/reflect/TypeUtils.html
	. maybe take a shortcut and implement it in a next future version
- add IListType:
	. getItemGetter(int)
	. getItemSetter(int,Obj)
- ReflectionUI parameter is often useless. Check
- polymorphiControl:
	. what if a polymorphic base type is a valid option itself (is concrete)?
	. what if there is only 1 subtype. use polymorphic control anyway?
- customizations editor recreates controls
and forms and often invalidates the customized UI
Ex: DialogAccessControl recreated while dialog open 
- secure cache ReflectionUI.precomputedTypeInfoByObject
- cleaning for end-developer:
	. add ReflectionUIError explicit messages
- rethink about read-only forms
- expose liscontrol selectionListening
- liscontrol:
	- allow to remove toolbar ???
- add ITypeInfo.hasValueOptions()???
- icons, expanded field value, ... should be part of basic type info,
not swing specific properties, as it common to most renderers and can
be ignored if not displayable??? 
- remove IListTypeInfo.getObjectSpecificItemConstructors???
- ITypeInfo.isModificationStackAccessible
	=> must be a SwingSpecificProperty???
- field periodic auto-update???
- allow to sort list view
- update ScreenShots
- update Example
- Fix all the tests
- MultipleFieldAsList with only 1 item???
- customizations :
	. filter lists: remove renamed or deleted targets???
- preset customizations object names must be special 
	. ex: prefixe with '.': Field ".position" or ".type"
- add class MetodSignature???
- add Customizations:
	. methods default param values
- For null field, allow custom instanciation
- menus???
- update translatable strings
- new controls:
	. spinner, slider for numbers
	. dateChooser
	. colorChooser
