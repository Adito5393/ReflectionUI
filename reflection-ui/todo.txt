- openObjectDialog() cannot detect changes of objects with only methods.
Change should be detected each time a rw method is invoked???
even if we o not know how to revert it
- guessing rules are too complicated to understand by 
developers. Maybe they should be moved to editable metadatas.
- metatada wysiwyg editor???
- it is impossible for custom field controls to prevent 
modfications of non-primitive values because readonly field
does not imply ICollectionSettings.allreadOnly for the field 
value  
- colors should never be set on components,
otherwise lookandfeel dynamic change is not taken into account.
See:
	. TextControl
	. listControl.treeControl
- menus???
- listControl: 
	. deatil view
- update translatable strings
- private => protected
- new controls:
	. spinner, slider for numbers
	. dateChooser
	. colorChooser
