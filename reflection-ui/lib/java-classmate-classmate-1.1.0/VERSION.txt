The official Big One-Oh version!

(no functional changes since 0.9.0)

0.9.0:

#14: Fixed 2 unit tests that failed with JDK 1.7 (due to addition of members to 'java.lang.Object`
  and `java.util.ArrayList`)
#15: ClassMate jar should include LICENSE file

0.8.0:

* Combine various ResolvedType.resolve(...) methods, using `java.lang.reflect.Type`
  as common super type
* Changed order arguments for "resolve" that takes TypeBindings and Type, to prevent
  problems with overloading: now TypeBindings is the first argument, not second

0.7.0:

#11: ResolvedType uses `java.lang.reflect.Type` to allow combination
  of Class<?>, GenericType and ResolvedType.
#12: ResolvedType now implements `java.lang.reflect.Type`

0.6.0:

#5: Make `GenericType` Serializable
 (suggested by Yuri S)
#8: Add additional pass-through methods in RawMember for all modifiers
 (requested by Phillip S)
